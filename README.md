# Java-photoConverter

This was a university school project.


This program runs with command line argument.
You need to give it a path to a folder name.

like: 
```bash
java Main c:\Users\photos
```

The program crawls the folder and the subfolders in it recursively.
Generate all images in the folder in .html and generates an index.html for the folder.
Than you can use in your browser like a photo viewer, and you can also scroll throught the folders.
